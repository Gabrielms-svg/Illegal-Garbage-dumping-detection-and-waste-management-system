Illegal Garbage Dump Detection & Waste Management System 


Abstract 

Our project is a web application (Named, Dump Surveillance AI) which aims for Illegal 
garbage dumping detection, analytics and waste management system. 
An AI-powered system to detect and report illegal garbage dumping using CCTV feeds. It 
employs YOLO object detection for identifying dumping activities, and uses clustering models 
to derive dumping analytics which is then used for Google Maps API to generate maps which 
visualises hotspots of illegal dumping areas for government authorities to take action, and 
additionally, users can locate legal dumping sites near them. Users can report illegal dumping 
activities through this platform media by uploading media, data and time, and location data of 
the offences. The system also aids users on waste management using chatbot. Illegal waste 
dumping is a major issue in India; this may be due to limited public access to legal disposal 
sites and lack of offender accountability. As a result, waste often accumulates in unauthorised 
and random places which leads to health and environmental risks from uncontrolled waste. 
Manual monitoring is inefficient, this project aims to automate monitoring, government 
authorities can make use of this web app to implement offender accountability.
